## Double peak criteria
- data : pure water
- usage : determination of the threshold value to distinguish between single and double peaks.

## Double peak Zebrafish
- data : Zebrafish XY and XZ
- usage : Presence of double (and even triple) peaks in a biological sample.

## Optical Resolution XY
- data : bead in agar 
- usage : determination of the optical XY resolution by imaging a bead in agar.

## Optical Resolution Z
- data : immersion oil and cover slip edge
- usage : determination of the optical Z resolution by imaging the edge between immersion oil and cover slip.

## Bandwidth range simulation
- data : synthetic lorenzian signals
- usage : verifying the needed bandwidth to accurately fit the signal.
