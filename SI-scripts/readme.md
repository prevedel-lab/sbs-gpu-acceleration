    They all use the old SBS pipeline. 
    Should I upgrade them ? or keep
    the historical one ?
    (or even better, not dupplicate the whole pipelines and files, and reference the official one)

## Double peak criteria
- data : pure water
- usage : determination of the threshold value to distinguish between single and double peaks.


## Double peak Zebrafish
- data : Zebrafish XY and XZ
- usage : Presence of double (and even triple !) peaks in a biological sample.

## Optical Resolution XY
- data : bead in agar 
- usage : determination the optical XY resolution by imaging a bead in agar.

## Optical Resolution Z
- data : bead in oil (?)
- usage : determination the optical Z resolution by imaging a bead in oil.

## Bandwith range simulation
- data : synthetic lorenzian signals
- usage : verifying the needed bandwith to accurately fit the signal.
